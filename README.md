## Development Notes

***Run `run.sh` to run the game.***

***Alternatively, run `cargo run -p build_script` before running the game.***

***There should be IntelliJ configurations for running the game. Simply run config `Run`.***

### Designers

For SVG files, in order for them to be correctly converted to Blender files, the file needs to fit the following
criteria:

- The viewport is *exactly* 160cm by 160cm (cm is used to reduce rounding errors).
- The file does not contain any color outside of fills.
    - That means, no gradients.
- The file does not contain any clipping or masking.
    - Use the boolean operators.
- The file does not contain any strokes.
    - Use "Stroke to Path" to convert them.

**Currently, the game supports neither materials nor textures,** ***and has no plans to support them.***

**Use either Vertex Paint or a material with only the base color (they get turned into vertex colors)**

### Scripts

`input.data` (aka DataMap) needs to be *manually assigned if you make modifications*.

### Software

The rendering is single-threaded, the game logic is run with an actor system on top of a Tokio runtime.

"Scripts" are called "functions" as the name is taken in-game by what would otherwise be called "recipes."

- The weird terminology comes from the fact that "recipes" doesn't make sense for machines.

#### Write all tile logic within functions

If you can't feasibly do that, *implement more handling in source code, and then write the logic in functions.*

### Translators
